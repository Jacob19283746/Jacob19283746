👋 Hi, I'm Yakov!

👨🏻‍💻 I'm a **Python Backend Developer** with 2 years of experience building high-load web applications and RESTful APIs.

🛠 My stack: FastAPI, Django/DRF, Flask, PostgreSQL, Docker, RabbitMQ, CI/CD, Go (basics).

🚀 I automate business processes, develop parsers and integrations (Bitrix24, Tilda), and optimize backend performance — achieving up to 35–40% API speed improvements.

📚 Constantly learning: currently exploring Go for high-performance systems, following backend trends, and maintaining pet projects on GitHub.
